## ðŸŽ‰ PLAN CANCELLATION & ACCESS CONTROL FIXES

### âœ… **Issues Fixed**

#### 1. **Activity Logging Error**
- **Problem**: `Class "Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity" not found`
- **Solution**: Replaced with Laravel's built-in `Log::info()` system
- **Result**: No more class not found errors

#### 2. **Success/Error Notifications**
- **Problem**: Using basic `alert()` popups
- **Solution**: Implemented professional toast notification system
- **Features**:
  - âœ… Success (green) and error (red) notifications
  - âœ… Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
  - âœ… Manual close button
  - âœ… Proper icons and styling

#### 3. **Server Access Control After Cancellation**
- **Problem**: Users stayed on manage-plan page after cancellation
- **Solution**: Automatic redirect to main shop after cancellation
- **Flow**: Cancel Plan â†’ Success notification â†’ Redirect to `/shop` after 2 seconds

#### 4. **Navigation Timing Issues**
- **Problem**: "Manage Plan" tab only appeared after page refresh
- **Solution**: Improved JavaScript injection with:
  - âœ… Initial load detection
  - âœ… React router history hooks
  - âœ… Retry mechanism with proper timing
  - âœ… Mutation observers for dynamic content

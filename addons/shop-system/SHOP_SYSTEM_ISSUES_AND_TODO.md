## üö® PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Database & Core Issues)

### ‚ùå **WALLET SYSTEM CRITICAL BUGS**

1. **CRITICAL: Wallet Balance Corruption**
   - **Issue**: Stored wallet balance (¬£7.13) doesn't match calculated balance from transactions (¬£1,172.87)
   - **Root Cause**: `UserWallet::deductFunds()` stores amounts as negative values, but transaction calculations expect positive amounts for debits
   - **Impact**: ¬£1,165.74 discrepancy - users can't trust their wallet balance
   - **Fix**: Correct the deductFunds method and recalculate all wallet balances
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Data integrity corruption

2. **Transaction Amount Storage Bug**
   - **Issue**: Debit transactions show as `-¬£-53.99` instead of `-¬£53.99` (double negative)
   - **Root Cause**: `UserWallet::deductFunds()` stores `amount` as `-$amount` when it should store positive amount with 'debit' type
   - **Impact**: Confusing transaction history and incorrect balance calculations
   - **Fix**: Store positive amounts for all transactions, rely on 'type' field for credit/debit
   - **Priority**: HIGH - User experience and data clarity

3. **Incorrect Transaction Types**
   - **Issue**: "Test deposit 1" and "Test deposit 2" recorded as debits instead of credits
   - **Impact**: Wallet balance calculations are incorrect
   - **Fix**: Validate transaction type matches the operation (deposits should be credits)
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Data accuracy

### ‚ùå **DATABASE SCHEMA ISSUES**

4. **Missing Paid At Column**
   - **Issue**: Orders table missing `paid_at` timestamp column that analytics queries expect
   - **Current**: We use `processed_at` in payments table instead
   - **Fix**: Add `paid_at` timestamp column to `shop_orders` table OR update analytics to use payments.processed_at
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Analytics queries fail

5. **Analytics Column Reference Bug**
   - **Issue**: Payment analytics queries use `method` column but table has `gateway` column
   - **Error**: `Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'method' in 'field list'`
   - **Fix**: Update all analytics queries to use `gateway` instead of `method`
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Analytics broken
